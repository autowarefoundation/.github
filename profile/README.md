The Autoware Foundation manages the development of Autoware, the world's leading open-source software project for autonomous driving, and sponsors Autoware-based projects all over the world. Autoware was started in 2015 and is being used by over 100 companies on more than 30 vehicles in over 20 different countries worldwide. 

### Repository overview
- [autowarefoundation/autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware)
  - Meta-repository containing `.repos` files to construct an Autoware workspace.
  - It is anticipated that this repository will be frequently forked by users, and so it contains minimal information to avoid unnecessary differences.
- [autowarefoundation/autoware_common](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_common)
  - Library/utility type repository containing commonly referenced ROS packages. 
  - These packages were moved to a separate repository in order to reduce CI execution time
- [autowarefoundation/autoware.core](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.core)
  - Main repository for high-quality, stable ROS packages for Autonomous Driving.
  - Based on [Autoware.Auto](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto) and [Autoware.Universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe).
- [autowarefoundation/autoware.universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe)
  - Repository for experimental, cutting-edge ROS packages for Autonomous Driving.
  - Autoware Universe was created to make it easier for researchers and developers to extend the functionality of Autoware Core
- [autowarefoundation/autoware_launch](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_launch)
  - Launch configuration repository containing node configurations and their parameters.
- [autowarefoundation/autoware-github-actions](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware-github-actions)
  - Contains [reusable GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/ja/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows).
  - Since Autoware has many repositories, making CI scripts DRY is efficient.
- [autowarefoundation/autoware-documentation](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware-documentation)
  - Documentation repository for Autoware users and developers.
  - Since Autoware Core/Universe has multiple repositories, a central documentation repository is more user-friendly than writing distributed documentation in each repository.
